# ShitChat

Wow was this a terrible app and idea that ArtificialBadger and I had.

This was supposed to be a meessaging applicaiton that would only allow you to access the app after you took a picture of a toilet. Thus proving that you were in the bathroom. After confirmation you'd be able to textually chat with other people around the world who are also visiting the oval office.
